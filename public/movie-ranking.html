<h1>The Best Movies According To Blake</h1>
<h2>This is my list of my top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The hobbit - Battle Of The Five Armys</h3>
<p>The last film in the hobbit trilogy, is by far in my opinion the best one yet. In this films you have fantastic acting, mezmorising action scences, and fully involved story line. i would give this films a 9.5/10 rating</p>

<h3>Alone In The Dark</h3>
<p>This film is an film which was produced in 2005, its is about a paranormal detective (edward carnby). Him and his friends are the only ones standing in the way of acient demons from threatening the world by coming back to life.
    The films story line is very well writen, and there are some points of very good acting by all the actors involved within this movie. i give it a rating off 8.5/10 </p>

    <h3>Black Clover, Sword Of The Wizard King</h3>
<p>This film is my favourte animated film that has been released to date, the story is off the actual series storyline however the story line is good in its own instance. The animation and thought behind ever part of this film is unique in my own point of view.
    They keep each characters unique personality and design. I would highly recommend this animated film to anyone that is interested in starting to watch anime. I give it a rating off 8.5/10
